description: "Background\nFor over two decades, the oncology community has relied on one-dimensional (1D) measurements to evaluate tumor response in clinical trials. The evolution of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) reflects a storied history rooted in its objective of providing a standard, effective, and efficient method of assessing treatment response. RECIST's unidimensional measurements were elegant in their simplicity compared to the previously proposed sum of bidimensional areas . This simplicity has made RECIST a cornerstone of oncology research. But clinical trials, imaging and technology have changed, and so must our metrics. We argue that 1D tumor measurement should no longer be the determinant of response. The treatment landscape has become more precise while RECIST has done the opposite. Tumors are three-dimensional entities where small linear changes can correspond to large volumetric shifts due to the non-linear relationship between diameter and volume. Intuitively, this means that volume is a more sensitive and responsive metric. While this concept is intuitive, no studies quantified the impact of the volumetric assessment of all lesions. To address this gap, we designed a simulation to assess how the number and selection of target lesions affect RECIST-based response classification accuracy and sensitivity, defined as the proportion of true progressive disease (PD) cases correctly identified, compared to using all lesions. \nMethods\nLesion-level radiomic features were obtained from a curated dataset consisting of 545 multimetastatic sarcoma patients. For each lesion, anatomical locations, 2D diameter and contoured volumes were extracted. These attributes served as the empirical basis for simulating realistic lesion profiles in synthetic patients. A synthetic cohort comprising 10,000 patients was generated to evaluate the impact of lesion selection on RECIST response classification. For each patient, the number of lesions was sampled from a Poisson distribution, constrained to a range of 1 to 30 lesions per patient. Individual lesions were randomly sampled with replacement from the empirical dataset to preserve realistic distributions. To simulate treatment effects, a fractional change in diameter was drawn from a truncated normal distribution (range [-100%,+300%], mean 0%, standard deviation 30%). Post-treatment lesion diameters were calculated by applying the simulated change to the baseline diameter. For each patient, the Sum of Longest Diameters (SLD) was calculated by summing the diameters of all lesions at baseline and post-treatment. The percent change in SLD was computed to quantify the overall response to treatment. Response categories were assigned based on RECIST 1.1 criteria; ‘true’ response classification was performed using all lesions per patient. To evaluate the impact of target lesion selection on response classification, a subsampling procedure was implemented. For each patient, up to i target lesions were randomly selected, with a maximum of two lesions per anatomical location. This process was repeated for values of i ranging from 1 to 10. For each subsample, SLD and RECIST responses were recalculated using only the selected target lesions. These subsampled responses were recorded alongside the full-lesion response for comparison. \nConclusions\nSensitivity to detection of progression increased as more lesions were included, with gains of up to 10% in absolute terms. Volume variability at the same diameter further illustrates that volume captures biological changes missed by linear metrics. Tracking volumetric changes longitudinally promises even greater sensitivity to early progression, enabling earlier intervention and more accurate trial endpoints. As progressive disease timepoints commonly inform clinical trial primary endpoints, it is imperative that metrics with maximum progression sensitivity are utilized."
